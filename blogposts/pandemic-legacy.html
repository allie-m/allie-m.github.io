        <p>Over the past 5 months, I have played a game of Pandemic Legacy
(Season 1) with my parents.</p>
<p>It’s critically acclaimed, and you should definitely play it with a
reliable group if you haven’t.</p>
<p>It’s certainly earned its rave reviews.</p>
<p>This is an account of our playthrough.</p>

The Story (Spoilers!!)
</summary>
<p>Here’s a glossary of the names we chose for the character cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliana as the scientist</li>
<li>Natasha as the researcher</li>
<li>Jules as the dispatcher</li>
<li>Derek as the medic</li>
<li>[We did not use the generalist]</li>
<li>Bobby as the quarantine specialist</li>
<li>Jimmy as the operations expert</li>
<li>Park as the colonel</li>
<li>Tony as the soldier</li>
<li>Marie as the virologist</li>
<li>Cesar as the immunologist</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="january">January</h3>
<p>We opened our game in January with Aliana, Natasha, and Jules [TODO
was it them?].</p>
<p>Our #1 opening priority was establishing permanent research stations
– freedom of movement is very important, and we didn’t know if we would
ever get the operations expert.</p>
<p>We added research stations to Cairo and Hong Kong, and were
successfully eliminating the diseases – that is, the yellow disease
mutated into the scary sounding CoDA [TODO].</p>
<p>We didn’t stress about it. It’s just one less disease to eliminate.
For our game end upgrades, we made our research stations permanent. This
way, we could maneuver the board easily from the start of the game.</p>
<h3 id="february">February</h3>
<p>Since we won January, we entered February with only 2 funded
events.</p>
<p>We didn’t know what to expect. And then… zombies!! Or Faded, rather,
they’re not really zombies as such. But they’re scary!</p>
<p>[TODO]</p>
