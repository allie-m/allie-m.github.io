        <p>june 17, 2024</p>
<p>this isn’t the kind of thing i normally intend to write here but <br>
(and sorry for the capitalization bait-and-switch, today we’re allll
lowercase) <br> you BETTER enjoy my stream of consciousness</p>
<p>so 11 days ago, on june 6, 2024, i graduated high school</p>
<p>and i don’t know how i feel about it</p>
<p>7 years at proof <br> i’ve loved it so so SO much</p>
<p>i know i’m gonna miss it <br> i miss it already <br> my amazing
teachers <br> and my friends <br> still at proof or scattered to the
wind <br> not to mention the institution itself, the patterns and
physical spaces and environment and atmosphere and ahhh</p>
<p>i don’t know if i’m selling it optimally <br> but i realize i’m not
selling anything that’d be really weird <br> i’m not a paid shill for
any dubiously reputed industry or product no matter what anyone
insinuates <br> yeah i’m not a salesperson i am just expressing my love
yeah we’re out of that cul-de-sac</p>
<p>ALSO shoutout to the people living in the half-space between friend
and acquaintance <br> y’all’re the ones i’m concerned i may not stay in
touch with <br> but i’ll miss every one of you ❤️</p>
<p>anyhow i am also excited about santa barbara!!!</p>
<p>it’s certainly a new thing <br> i’ll be heading down for orientation
in a few weeks <br> advanced cs classes :D <br> computer graphics
specialists :DDDD</p>
<p>so yeah it’s a <del>bittersweet?</del> <del>mixed?</del>
<del>tangy?</del> good-sad bag <br> as in sad but like good <br> sad
doesn’t have to mean bad, i was recently taught <br> nor do endings <br>
which is why i’m not a time traveler</p>
<p>i’m not really sure where i’m going with this but</p>
<p>to recap</p>
<p>to my teachers, my friends, my classmates: <br> i love you :)</p>
<p>to my future self, <br> STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM OK <br> and make sure
you’re having the most fun <br> and making more friends <br> and
offering people cabbage <br> and being a good person <br> it’s been
pretty darn good let’s keep it that way</p>
<p>yeah that’s all i wanted to say i think <br> hugs and love to you and
me and the world <br> ❤️❤️❤️</p>
<p>we’ll see how it plays out later</p>
