        <p>Over the past 5 months, I have played a game of Pandemic Legacy
(Season 1) with my parents.</p>
<p>It’s critically acclaimed, and you should definitely play it with a
reliable group if you haven’t.</p>
<p>It’s certainly earned its rave reviews.</p>
<p>This is an account of our playthrough.</p>
<details>
<summary>
The Story (Spoilers!!)
</summary>
<p>To start, here’s a glossary of the names we chose for the character
cards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliana as the scientist</li>
<li>Natasha as the researcher</li>
<li>Jules as the dispatcher</li>
<li>Derek as the medic</li>
<li>[We did not use the generalist, so she was never named]</li>
<li>Bobby as the quarantine specialist</li>
<li>Jimmy as the operations expert</li>
<li>Park as the colonel</li>
<li>Tony as the soldier</li>
<li>Marie as the virologist</li>
<li>Cesar as the immunologist</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="january">January</h3>
<p>We opened our game in January with Aliana, Natasha, and Derek.</p>
<p>Our #1 opening priority was establishing research stations – freedom
of movement is very important, and we didn’t know if we would ever get
an operations expert.</p>
<p>We added research stations to Cairo and Hong Kong, and were cruising
to a relatively easy victory.</p>
<p>And then, oh no! The yellow disease mutated into the scary sounding
COdA-403a: untreatable and incurable!</p>
<p>Thankfully, we were already quite close to victory, and we managed to
squeak by with no unstable cities or scarred characters.</p>
<p>As our game end upgrades, we made our research stations permanent.
This way, we could maneuver the board easily from the start of the game
– again, we’re big believers in the importance of freedom of movement in
Pandemic.</p>
<h3 id="february">February</h3>
<p>Since we won January, we entered February with only 2 funded
events.</p>
<p>And a quarantine specialist!? Hooray, we have a way to manage this
untreatable illness.</p>
<p>For this game, we selected Aliana, Natasha, and Bobby – we left Derek
behind, since he’s not able to manage COdA.</p>
<p>We managed to win without any scars and with only minor damage to a
few cities on the board.</p>
<h3 id="march">March</h3>
<p>An operations expert!!</p>
