This 4-map collection depicts an alternate universe of Bay Area public transportation.

Inspired by a [Market Street Railway article](https://www.streetcar.org/market-street-subway-dreams/),
the premise of this alternate history is that the Market/Geary/Mission streetcar-subway trifecta was constructed in 1937,
when it was placed on the ballot.

This proposal would have constructed three subways:

- The Geary St subway, running from Fillmore towards Market, turning north at Montgomery and running underground til around Sacramento St; the E/F and B/C are interlined through this subway
- The Market St subway, going underground at Valencia, running down Market until it turns south to meet the Transbay Terminal.
- The Mission St subway, branching from the Market subway at Van Ness and emerging onto a surface right-of-way a little past 30th/Mission.

The maps in this collection extrapolate this world forward to the present.

In short:

- The Market Street Railway is dismantled in much the same fashion as in our universe. Trolleybuses!!
- The H Potrero survives the purges intact; the SFMR resolves to keep all its streetcars, since most are at least partially grade-separated, and so this all-surface crosstown line is able to tag along.
- The Key System is municipalized while still intact, and merged with the SFMR (San Francisco Municipal Railway) to create the SF&EBMR (San Francisco & East Bay Municipal Railway); the transbay streetcars are preserved.
- The cable cars are preserved as they existed in 1954, instead of being cut in half as in our universe.
- Treasure Island is given to SF as an airport! (later renamed Harvey Milk International Airport)
- BART does not get built; San Francisco is passed over for Great Society-era rapid transit construction, because of the SF&EB's already adequate streetcar-subway system. Instead, in the mid 60s, there is a capital project to alleviate streetcar congestion in the Market subway and increase throughput. The Market subway is deepened, and another set of tracks is built below the original. These tracks are extended to meet the Twin Peaks tunnel, and the KLM are rerouted to use them; the JNP continue to run in the original level, which still emerges onto the street at Valencia.
- In the 90s, California pours large amounts of funding into intercity and commuter rail construction; the result is a robust commuter rail network that perfectly complements the core streetcar network.
- The SF&EB streetcars are rationalized into the Muni system, and modernized with articulated low-floor trams, universal ADA compliance, and automatic train control. There's also an effort to improve the quality of street stops, with physically separated boarding zones.
- Minor tweaks over time to Muni, slightly extending the F/J/K/M/P (SF) and F (East Bay).
- The operational characteristics of the bus network is fairly underspecified in these maps, but in my head I picture we have East Bay trolleybuses on the legacy local Key streetcars, tentatively the 1/3/4R/5/6/9/11/18.

It may be a little utopian, but can't a girl fantasize about what could have been? At least it's grounded in an interesting historical what-if :)
