this isn't the kind of thing i normally intend to write here but
<br>
(and sorry for the capitalization bait-and-switch, today we're allll lowercase)
<br>
you BETTER enjoy my stream of consciousness

so 11 days ago, on june 6, 2024, i graduated high school

and i don't know how i feel about it

7 years at proof
<br>
i've loved it so so SO much

i know i'm gonna miss it
<br>
i miss it already
<br>
my amazing teachers
<br>
and my friends
<br>
still at proof or scattered to the wind
<br>
not to mention the institution itself, the patterns and physical spaces and environment and atmosphere and ahhh

i don't know if i'm selling it optimally
<br>
but i realize i'm not selling anything that'd be really weird
<br>
i'm not a paid shill for any dubiously reputed industry or product no matter what anyone insinuates
<br>
yeah i'm not a salesperson i am just expressing my love yeah we're out of that cul-de-sac

ALSO shoutout to the people living in the half-space between friend and acquaintance
<br>
y'all're the ones i'm concerned i may not stay in touch with
<br>
but i'll miss every one of you ❤️

anyhow i am also excited about santa barbara!!!

it's certainly a new thing
<br>
i'll be heading down for orientation in a few weeks
<br>
advanced cs classes :D
<br>
computer graphics specialists :DDDD

so yeah it's a ~~bittersweet?~~ ~~mixed?~~ ~~tangy?~~ good-sad bag
<br>
as in sad but like good
<br>
sad doesn't have to mean bad, i was recently taught
<br>
nor do endings
<br>
which is why i'm not a time traveler

i'm not really sure where i'm going with this but

to recap

to my teachers, my friends, my classmates:
<br>
i love you :)

to my future self,
<br>
STAY IN TOUCH WITH THEM OK
<br>
and make sure you're having the most fun
<br>
and making more friends
<br>
and offering people cabbage
<br>
and being a good person
<br>
it's been pretty darn good let's keep it that way

yeah that's all i wanted to say i think
<br>
hugs and love to you and me and the world
<br>
❤️❤️❤️

we'll see how it plays out later
