    <summary>All The Young Dudes</summary>

    In my 10th grade year, I and most of my grade
    read this book together. The seminal Harry Potter fanfiction that spawned
    the Marauders fandom, this 500k word experience is at once
    heartbreaking, sweet, depressing, beautiful, it is a slow burn and
    an emotional rollercoaster that made us all cry at least once.

    Delightfully self-indulgent, this series is jam-packed with
    wish fulfillment and nerd references, it is fluffy and fun.
    It's not the most thoughtful sci-fi you'll ever encounter,
    but I had a blast listening to it, and eagerly await the next sequel.
