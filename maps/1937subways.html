<p>This 4-map collection depicts an alternate universe of Bay Area
public transportation.</p>
<p>Inspired by a <a
href="https://www.streetcar.org/market-street-subway-dreams/">Market
Street Railway article</a>, the premise of this alternate history is
that the Market/Geary/Mission streetcar-subway trifecta was constructed
in 1937, when it was placed on the ballot.</p>

<p>This proposal would have constructed three subways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Geary St subway, running from Fillmore towards Market, turning
north at Montgomery and running underground til around Sacramento St;
the E/F and B/C are interlined through this subway</li>
<li>The Market St subway, going underground at Valencia, running down
Market until it turns south to meet the Transbay Terminal.</li>
<li>The Mission St subway, branching from the Market subway at Van Ness
and emerging onto a surface right-of-way a little past
30th/Mission.</li>
</ul>
<p>The maps in this collection extrapolate this world forward to the
present.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Market Street Railway is dismantled in much the same fashion as
in our universe. Trolleybuses!!</li>
<li>The H Potrero survives the purges intact; the SFMR resolves to keep
all its streetcars, since most are at least partially grade-separated,
and so this all-surface crosstown line is able to tag along.</li>
<li>The Key System is municipalized while still intact, and merged with
the SFMR (San Francisco Municipal Railway) to create the SF&amp;EBMR
(San Francisco &amp; East Bay Municipal Railway); the transbay
streetcars are preserved.</li>
<li>The cable cars are preserved as they existed in 1954, instead of
being cut in half as in our universe.</li>
<li>Treasure Island is given to SF as an airport! (later renamed Harvey
Milk International Airport)</li>
<li>BART does not get built; San Francisco is passed over for Great
Society-era rapid transit construction, because of the SF&amp;EB’s
already adequate streetcar-subway system. Instead, in the mid 60s, there
is a capital project to alleviate streetcar congestion in the Market
subway and increase throughput. The Market subway is deepened, and
another set of tracks is built below the original. These tracks are
extended to meet the Twin Peaks tunnel, and the KLM are rerouted to use
them; the JNP continue to run in the original level, which still emerges
onto the street at Valencia.</li>
<li>In the 90s, California pours large amounts of funding into intercity
and commuter rail construction; the result is a robust commuter rail
network that perfectly complements the core streetcar network.</li>
<li>The SF&amp;EB streetcars are rationalized into the Muni system, and
modernized with articulated low-floor trams, universal ADA compliance,
and automatic train control. There’s also an effort to improve the
quality of street stops, with physically separated boarding zones.</li>
<li>Minor tweaks over time to Muni, slightly extending the F/J/K/M/P
(SF) and F (East Bay).</li>
<li>The operational characteristics of the bus network is fairly
underspecified in these maps, but in my head I picture we have East Bay
trolleybuses on the legacy local Key streetcars, tentatively the
1/3/4R/5/6/9/11/18.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be a little utopian, but can’t a girl fantasize about what
could have been? At least it’s grounded in an interesting historical
what-if :)</p>
